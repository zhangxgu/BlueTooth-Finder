# BlueTooth-Finder
# This is a homework from computer networks.

THis is a BlueTooth-Finder with Android Studio. You can open Android Studio and open the file MyApplication as a work space. Then let two telephones download the app. After that, you can randomly choose one as server with the other one client. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The functions are all about these three parts:


1. Show the distance between two phones with a RSS number. And when the distance is bigger than a threshold, the phone will ring.


2. You can also make the phone ring with the other one no matter which one is the server.


3. When the client phone is far away from the server, we can see a location in server's screen which is made up by ongitude and latitude.

The UI is not so beautiful. HAHA!
